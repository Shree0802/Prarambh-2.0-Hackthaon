## 1. Product Vision & Ecosystem Architecture
EDUTECH is an **AI-powered evidence-based skill intelligence and industry readiness platform**. Instead of relying solely on self-declared resumes or CGPAs, EDUTECH verifies practical competency, identifies industry skill gaps against target roles, generates personalized multi-phase learning paths, and provides evidence-backed candidate evaluation for employers and institutional analytics for colleges.

```text
LEARN → PRACTICE → DEMONSTRATE → VERIFY → MEASURE → ANALYZE → IDENTIFY GAPS → PERSONALIZE LEARNING → RE-ASSESS → BUILD VERIFIED PORTFOLIO → CONNECT WITH INDUSTRY
```

## 2. Jury Showcase Control Panel (1-Click Presets)
EDUTECH features a sticky top **Jury Control Panel** (`JuryShowcaseBanner.jsx`) designed specifically for rapid hackathon evaluation. Judges can launch 5 complete end-to-end user journeys with a single click:

1. 🚀 **Scenario 1: Skill Gap & AI Remediation**: Switches to Student profile → runs gap analysis (51% gap in Statistics) → auto-assigns remedial micro-course → updates readiness score to 86%.
2. 🛡️ **Scenario 2: AI Code & Anti-Fraud Engine**: Switches to Admin → triggers Github Repo Parser on "AI Resume Analyzer" → checks commit depth (28 commits), author identity, originality score (89%), and issue audit hash.
3. 💻 **Scenario 3: Monaco Code Sandbox**: Launches Monaco Code Editor → executes Python Kadane's algorithm & SQL queries with automated test suite runners.
4. 🎓 **Scenario 4: Faculty Curriculum Alignment**: Switches to Faculty → analyzes CS department heatmaps → flags 58% Cloud gap → launches 1-click curriculum intervention builder for 42 affected students.
5. 💼 **Scenario 5: Employer Precision Search & Dossier**: Switches to Recruiter → filters candidates by Python >= 80% & verified evidence → inspects code dossier → sends formal interview invitation modal.

## 3. Comprehensive Feature Breakdown

### A. Academic Profile & Learning Record (`AcademicProfilePage.jsx`)
* **CGPA vs Practical Competency Separation**: Academic CGPA (8.6/10.0) is tracked separately from demonstrated practical competency (78%) so coursework grades do not artificially skew industry readiness.
* **Interactive Marks Editor**: Interactive subject marks slider/editor with real-time CGPA recalculation and subject-to-skill mapping.

### B. Personalized Skill Graph & Evidence Strength (`SkillGraphPage.jsx`)
* **Dynamic Connected Graph**: Connected nodes linking `Student → Skills → Evidence → Projects → Assessments → Target Roles`.
* **Evidence Strength Indicators**: Displays `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, or `LOW` evidence strength badges accompanied by hover explanations detailing why.

### C. Standardized Competency Level System (0 to 5) (`CompetencyLevelBadge.jsx`)
* **Level 0 (0-20%)**: No Evidence
* **Level 1 (21-40%)**: Beginner
* **Level 2 (41-60%)**: Developing
* **Level 3 (61-75%)**: Intermediate
* **Level 4 (76-90%)**: Advanced
* **Level 5 (91-100%)**: Industry Ready

### D. Skill Evidence 5-Source Weighting (`competencyEngine.js`)
* **5-Source Formula**: Technical Assessment (30%), Practical Coding Runner (25%), Verified GitHub Projects (25%), Portfolio Evidence (10%), and Certification Verification (10%).

### E. Re-Assessment Loop & Competency Growth (`StudentDashboard.jsx`)
* **Closed Feedback Loop**: `Initial Assessment (51%) → Gap Identified → Learning Module Completed → Re-assessment → Score Improved (68%) → Gap Reduced`.
* **Growth History Chart**: Recharts line visualization illustrating month-over-month competency growth (Sept 51% → Oct 64% → Nov 73%).

### F. Learning Management Hub & 30-Day AI Roadmap (`LearningHubPage.jsx`)
* **Time Commitment Selector**: Toggle daily learning commitment (`1 Hour / Day` vs `2 Hours / Day`).
* **30-Day Intensive ML Roadmap**: Paced 4-week daily task sequence with status toggles (`Start Learning`, `Mark Complete`).

### G. AI Mock Interview Module (`MockInterviewPage.jsx`)
* **Real-time AI Interview**: Interactive question generator and response evaluator across Technical, HR, and Mixed interview formats.
* **Structured Evaluation**: Feedback breakdown assessing Technical Relevance, Completeness, and Structure with concrete improvement suggestions.

### H. Faculty Intervention Builder (`CurriculumGaps.jsx`)
* **Institutional Gap Alert**: Institutional heatmap highlighting skill deficits (e.g. 58% Cloud Computing deficit).
* **Curriculum Intervention Modal**: 1-click workshop & bridge course deployment auto-enrolling affected cohort students.

### I. Employer Precision Discovery & Direct Invitation (`CandidateDiscovery.jsx`)
* **Evidence-First Ranking**: Ranks candidates by verified role fit & GitHub code evidence.
* **Verified Candidate Dossier**: View candidate code commits, project verification score, and verified certifications.
* **Formal Interview Invitation Modal**: Sends customized interview invitations linking candidate verification proof.

### J. Public Verified Digital Portfolio & QR Code (`PublicPortfolioPage.jsx`)
* **Public/Private Toggle**: Student-controlled portfolio privacy settings.
* **Shareable URL**: `/portfolio/:userId` showing student bio, verified skills, code repos, and trust badges.
* **Portfolio QR Code**: SVG QR code generator for instant mobile scanning by recruiters.

### K. Anti-Fraud & Evidence Integrity Layer (`AdminVerificationCenter.jsx`)
* **System Audit Log**: Real-time logging of all verification, submission, and role changes.
* **Neutral Integrity Flags**: Assigns `Clean`, `Requires Review`, `Potential Inconsistency`, or `Insufficient Evidence` to trigger faculty/admin reviews.

## 4. Technology Stack

* **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React icons, Recharts, Framer Motion, Monaco Editor.
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js REST API.
* **Database**: MongoDB & Mongoose schemas with an automatic in-memory fallback store for offline/demo environments.
